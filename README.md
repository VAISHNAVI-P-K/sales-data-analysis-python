# Project Title: Sales Data Analysis and Reporting Using Python

Week-2 Internship Project

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing structured sales data using Python to calculate revenue, evaluate product and category performance, and identify sales trends. It simulates real-world data analysis workflows by transforming raw sales records into meaningful insights that support business decision-making.

## Project Objectives

* Analyze sales data using Python to compute revenue metrics and generate overall sales summaries

* Evaluate product-wise, category-wise, and monthly sales performance to identify key trends and revenue drivers

* Transform raw sales data into actionable business insights through structured analysis and reporting

## Project Workflow 

1. **Dataset Creation & Structuring** - 
A well-structured sales dataset containing more than 50 records was created, including order details such as order ID, order date, product, category, quantity, and price. Proper column naming and data consistency were maintained to ensure analytical readiness.

2. **Revenue Calculation Accuracy** - 
For each sales record, total revenue was accurately calculated using quantity and price. This step ensured reliable revenue figures at both the individual order and aggregate levels.

3. **Sales Analysis & Reporting** - 
Comprehensive analysis was performed to generate overall sales summaries, product-wise and category-wise performance metrics, and monthly sales trends. These analyses provided actionable insights into revenue drivers and sales behavior.

4. **Code Clarity & Notebook Structure** - 
The notebook was organized into logical sections with clear execution flow. Clean, readable code and meaningful outputs were used to enhance understandability and reproducibility.

5. **Version Control & Submission Quality** - 
The project artifacts, including the notebook, processed dataset, and documentation, were systematically uploaded to GitHub with a clear repository structure and a concise README outlining objectives, workflow, and insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used

▪︎ Python – Core programming language

▪︎ Google Colab – A cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment used for project development and execution.

▪︎ Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation

▪︎ NumPy - Dataset creation and support numerical operations

▪︎ GitHub – Version control and project submission

## Output

* Created a structured sales dataset with 50+ records

* Calculated total sales revenue for each order

* Generated overall sales summary including total revenue and total orders

* Performed product-wise and category-wise sales performance analysis

* Conducted monthly sales trend analysis using order dates

* Exported the final processed dataset as a CSV file for reporting

## Key Insights

* Certain products consistently generate higher revenue, indicating strong customer demand

* The Electronics category contributes the majority of overall sales

* Monthly analysis shows stable and consistent sales performance across the observed period

* These insights can support data-driven decisions in inventory planning and sales strategy

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a structured approach to sales data analysis using Python, transforming raw transactional data into actionable business insights. Through accurate revenue calculation and focused performance analysis, the project highlights key sales drivers and trends. The outcome reflects strong analytical fundamentals, clear business understanding, and effective reporting practices.
