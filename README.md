# Project Title: Sales Data Analysis and Reporting Using Python

Week-2 Internship Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing structured sales data using Python to derive meaningful business insights. The objective is to simulate real-world data analysis tasks performed by junior data analysts, including revenue calculation, performance evaluation, and trend analysis. The project demonstrates practical skills in data handling, analytical thinking, and business-oriented reporting.

## Project Workflow (Aligned with Evaluation Criteria)

1. **Dataset Creation & Structuring** - 
A well-structured sales dataset containing more than 50 records was created, including order details such as order ID, order date, product, category, quantity, and price. Proper column naming and data consistency were maintained to ensure analytical readiness.

2. **Revenue Calculation Accuracy** - 
For each sales record, total revenue was accurately calculated using quantity and price. This step ensured reliable revenue figures at both the individual order and aggregate levels.

3. **Sales Analysis & Reporting** - 
Comprehensive analysis was performed to generate overall sales summaries, product-wise and category-wise performance metrics, and monthly sales trends. These analyses provided actionable insights into revenue drivers and sales behavior.

4. **Code Clarity & Notebook Structure** - 
The notebook was organized into logical sections with clear execution flow. Clean, readable code and meaningful outputs were used to enhance understandability and reproducibility.

5. **Version Control & Submission Quality** - 
The project artifacts, including the notebook, processed dataset, and documentation, were systematically uploaded to GitHub with a clear repository structure and a concise README outlining objectives, workflow, and insights.
